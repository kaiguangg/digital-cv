          This project  is to suggest new passwords for users by using a "training" process. The idea is to have the software propose password combinations that align with users' preferences for creating their own passwords. For instance, if a user often uses multiple alphabets from their children's names, the software will suggest secure password options that still cater to the user's preferences.

      Outside of my desk job, I prefer spending most of my time outdoors. I enjoy activities like swimming, bouldering, and badminton. 
      Additionally, I love going for a short getaway and watching movies for relaxation and entertainment. 
      Also, I make sure to stay informed about the latest tech trends and updated news by reading articles and staying up-to-date with relevant information. This helps me stay current with the ever-evolving world of technology and allows me to explore new opportunities in the field.
